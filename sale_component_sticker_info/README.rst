Sale - Component Sticker Info
#############################

Group products on sale order by its category group. If multiple products
on sale order have same group, it will have it sequenced. For example
Group called ``A`` will start sequence as ``A-1``, then ``A-2`` and so
on.

This is prerequisite to form Product Component Sticker information using
manufactured product.
